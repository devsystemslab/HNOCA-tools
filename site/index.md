# Welcome the Website of the Human Neural Organoid Cell Atlas (HNOCA)

The Human Neural Organoid Cell Atlas (HNOCA) is a collection of single-cell RNA-seq data from human brain organoids. The HNOCA is a resource for the scientific community to explore the cellular composition of human brain organoids and to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development and disease.

## Installation
